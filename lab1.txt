The Lords of the Fallen takes place more than a thousand years after the events of the first game. Embark on an all-new adventure in a vast, interconnected world, more than five times larger than the original game. The Lords of the Fallen is filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative where players will need to create their own hero before tackling the single player campaign. They will also have the option to invite a second player to join their adventure in uninterrupted online co-op.
